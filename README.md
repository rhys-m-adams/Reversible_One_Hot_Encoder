# Reversible One Hot Encoder for machine learning.
This class one hot encodes a pandas DataFrame matrix into a dense numpy ndarray.
I wrote this class to be reversible so that you could quickly determine which
parameters fit corresponded to original features. I wrote an example file in
OHE_demo.ipynb. This was all written using dense matrices. 

This code was run in  Python 3.8.5.
